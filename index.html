            <p>Founded in 08/15/2013 from the brave decision of Akeem Kafumba, knowing how hard a child’s life could be, we were born fighting for a healthy life with dignity to our litle ones.</p>
            <p>The socioeconomic, educational and health conditions are major problems in the world affecting children, since many of them cannot overcome these obstacles, and don’t even have the  basics to assure their existence.</p>
            <p>After many meetings thinking about the troubles in our children’s lives, we decided to unite our strength and search for solutions to these problems, and thus the World Child Care Vision was born.</p>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>The name came by realizing that the same issues faced by the children of Africa could be found in many other places in the world. Our goal is to be worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>The first step was taken with distribution of books, pens and clothes, all bought with Akeem’s own effort, and now we aim to build an organization strong enough to be the pillars that our children need to grow up.</p>

              <p>Our headquarters are located at Kyangwali Refugee Camp, in the Hoima district, in Uganda.</p>
              <p>We are 287km to the northwest of the capital, Kampala.</p>
              <p>Kyangwali hosts approximately 30,000 refugees, mostly Congolese and Sudanese.The journey from Hoima district town to Kyangwali takes more than four stressful hours on dirty bumpy roads.</p>
              <p>The camp was established in the 1960s for Rwandan refugees but, at present, it is mainly home to Congolese refugees. The official number (in 2010, according to independent.co.ug) of refugees </p>

              <p>from Congo, Burundi, Rwanda and Sudan is between 20,000 and 25,000 on camp, although the refugees themselves say they are over 30,000.</p>
              <p>Uganda's healthcare performance is ranked as one of the worst in the world by the World Health Organization (WHO). Uganda is ranked 186th out of 191 nations.</p>
              <p>Doctors and nurses generally stay in urban areas where pay and living conditions are better.</p>
              <p>One solution to this healthcare crisis is to provide healthcare to poor rural communities and to refugees living in the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement Camp.</p>

          <p>Founder-member born in Congo in 12/21/1986, comes from a background of struggling and overcoming. He suffered with the loss of his parents as a kid, due to rebel attacks. He grew up and studied in Goma, whence, years laters, in 2011, he had to run away  from the violence of war, when suddenly night attacks started to target students.</p>
          <p>He then went to Kiwaja, a village 100km from Goma, where the rebel attacks continued. He ran once again to Isasha, in the Uganda border, which was a door for the new country, and settled down in Kyangwali Refugee camp, about 300km from the capital, Kampala.
          Lead by his extreme experiences with poverty and danger, and with a promise and personal commitment with God, he decided to devote himself to take care of other children who may have been through similar problems.</p>
          <p>After getting into the refugee camp, he noticed the great number of children that were not going to a school, suffering with jiggers and other diseases, and were mostly orphans. Some left their studies for the lack of school materials, clothes or even food, and for not having someone to look after them.</p>
          <p>These same problems were found on the 14 villages that he went through.
           Seeing the severity of the situation, Akeem assembled a meeting with parents trying to find a collective solution, without much success, since everyone there were refugees in harsh conditions of living.</p>
          <p>Besides all of those conflicts, there was also the lack of medicine for basic care, even in the local heath centers.</p>
          <p>Then Akeem  started to work as a supervisor in the Medics Without Borders NGO, dealing directly with children epidemic diseases.
          After all that and with a lot of humanitarian experience, he founded World Child Care Vision, aiming for socially and economically free children empowered by education, trying to assure a proper future to each one of them.</p>
