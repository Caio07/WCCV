            <p>Kyangwali hosts approximately 30,000 refugees, mostly Congolese and Sudanese.The journey from Hoima district town to Kyangwali takes more than four stressful hours on dirty bumpy roads.</p>

            <p>Uganda's healthcare performance is ranked as one of the worst in the world by the World Health Organization (WHO). Uganda is ranked 186th out of 191 nations.
            <br/>Doctors and nurses generally stay in urban areas where pay and living conditions are better.
            <br/>One solution to this healthcare crisis is to provide healthcare to poor rural communities and to refugees living in the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement Camp.</p>
